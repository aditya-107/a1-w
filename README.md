b.This Android App gives us the day for the appropriate date we entered. If our Date is not valid it displays which field is  invalid. If the year is invalid it displays "Invalid Year" it wont check for month and so on.
We haven't encountered any bugs so far, except for handling extremely large dates, which are considered out of scope. However, there may still be some edge cases that haven't been covered.


c.
Task1: We implemented input validation in the 'DateModel' class to handle invalid date entries. This includes checking for February 29th in non-leap years, validating months with 31 days, and ensuring that both month and day inputs are within acceptable ranges.
Task2:We  refered to Android Documentation and also some youtube resourses as we were doing the project in this feild for the first time  also used google for logic building and stackoverflow for debugging
Task3: Made changes in the DateModel.java class that would display error prompts when an user enters invalid input.

 


d.We began development with the constraints in mind, and upon completion, we tested the app. Fortunately, the app did not crash during the initial testing with valid entries.


e.Around 5 working hours. 

f.We would rate it 3/5. 

g. We would rate it 5/10.
